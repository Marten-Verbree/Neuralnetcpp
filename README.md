# Neuralnetcpp

In this project, the goal is to write a trainable neural network in C++.

To start, I have created Matrix Classes using Class templates with different options for initialization.

After that, the Linear and ReLU layers were implemented, with random weight initialization. 

These layers are then combined to form a neural network.

Functions for metrics such as mean squared error (loss & gradient) as well as accuracy were implemented.

Lastly, in the main function, the model is trained for the xor problem.
